A Demon Supernova

Network enabled RPG Game built with ImpactJS. I've run out of time/interest to pursue this but it is a great starting point for someone looking to learn how to develop a game like this. It has a NodeJS server that interacts with a database, and had facebook integration, until they recently changed over their graph api format...Haven't made it work with that, so its disabled right now.

You must do the following to get this to work:

a) Have NodeJS set up and SocketIO and MySQL modules for it
b) Set up a Mysql database connection and create a table for players. Example table is included at players.sql
c) The service uses SSL so you will need an SSL certificate to exist in the root as ssl.key and ssl.crt. Modify server.js to use a different file name, etc.
d) Modify the client to know where the server is, in client/lib/game/main.js
e) If you use a different user ID than the one thats basically hardcoded in right now, you'll need to update that in client/lib/game/main.js as well.
f) Bring your own licensed version of ImpactJS to put in client/lib/impact


To get it going, once all of these prerequisites have been set up, start the server

nodejs server.js

Then visit https://your-IP, and accept the SSL warning.
